## Description

The Credentials Store is a console application developed in the .NET environment, designed to securely manage sensitive information. It utilizes WCF for communication between different parts of the application, with X509 certificates for authentication, digital signatures for data integrity, and AES in CBC mode for encryption. The project also includes the creation of custom event log objects that can be viewed and monitored using the Event Viewer application, providing an additional layer of security and auditing capabilities.
